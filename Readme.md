Recently i was looking for elegant solution of
the simpliest arduino/avr based spwm device or a more
common name the inverter. And after some scretching of the 
internet, doing my researches in that field, finally
i came up with a simple approach of homebrew
dc/ac inverter
* The main idea was using these proto boards 
  From arduino.cc project like nano, uno etc.
* Also to use the chipiest and simple circuitry
  so anyone else could have did it for themselves
* Especially for those people in Ukraine suffering
  Of shelling and blackouts on a daily bases
